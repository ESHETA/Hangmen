# hangmen
Hangmen is a word guessing game which we all have enjoyed in childhood. It was a fun way to enhance our vocabulary. It was made from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

To build a Hangman game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we followed these step-by-step instructions:
1. Created a folder named Hangmen.
2. Created an index.html file. The file name should be index and its extension .html
3. Created a style.css file. The file name should be style and its extension .css
4. Created a scripts folder with word-list.js and script.js files. The extension of the files should be .js and files should be inside the scripts folder.
5. We Downloaded and placed the Images folder in our project directory. This folder includes the necessary images and gifs for the game.
6. THEn finally we ran the html file.
